          <h2>Oslo</h2>
          <p>
            The Norwegian capital Oslo is located on the south coast of the
            country at the entrance to the Oslofjord. The city is known for its
            green spaces and museums. Many of these cultural institutions - such
            as the Norwegian Maritime Museum on the shore or the
            Vikingskipshuset with Viking ships from the 9th century - are
            located on the Bygdøy peninsula. The Holmenkollbakken ski jump
            offers a beautiful panoramic view of the fjord.

            The Viking Age (793–1066 AD) was the period during the Middle Ages
            when Norsemen known as Vikings undertook large-scale raiding,
            colonizing, conquest and trading throughout Europe, and reached
            North America

          <p>
            During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken. Oslo was founded
            as a city at the end of the Viking Age in the year 1040 under the
            name Ánslo, and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048
            by Harald Hardrada. The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and
            a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with
            Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its
            influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign
            of King Christian IV, a new city was built closer to Akershus
            Fortress and named Christiania in the king's honour. It was
            established as a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January
            1838. The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the
            1814–1905 union between Sweden and Norway. From 1877, the city's
            name was spelled Kristiania in government usage, a spelling that was
            adopted by the municipal authorities only in 1897. In 1925 the city,
            after incorporating the village retaining its former name, was
            renamed Oslo. In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker, a municipality which
            surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger, thus creating
            the modern, vastly enlarged Oslo municipality.
